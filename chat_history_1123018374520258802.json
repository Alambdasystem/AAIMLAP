I will be working in the lower parts of the channel list ( below ----Staging Area----) so please leave those alone for the moment":{" I should be done in an hour or so":{"":"Okay all changes are ready to go. Some notes for going forward --\nYou can still see the old threads in <#1053437827108585494> but cannot send messages in them. Please move to the new designated channels.\n\n### If you see #deleted-channel in an end of support thread message,\nThe channel has not been deleted! You just don't have the adequate permissions to view it yet. Please reach out in <#1123021543518244916>. A great way to check this is by clicking on your profile in this server and looking under **roles**. This should list all the teams you are a part of.\n\n### If you see the channels for a team that you  are on in the navigator,\nReach out in <#1123021543518244916> for a moderator to add you to that team\n\nThis will take a little getting used to, but I'm confident in the changes being better for everyone once we get used to it. Please reach out if you're having problems!"}}}]
